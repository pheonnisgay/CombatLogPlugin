# CombatLogPlugin
This is a plugin that kills people when they log out in a certain amount of time after recieving damage by another player.


# Features:
-You can forbid commands during combat using /forbid </command> as an example you can forbid /spawn with /forbid /spawn. And even if the command has multiple arguments or just one just type the beginning and it will be blocked during combat.

-When you are in combat you have a scoreboard which shows you the remaining time you are in combat.
here is what it looks like:

this is sadly not customizable yet but i will work on making it fully customizable in the future!

-You can set a custom combat time in the config.

-You can also customize things like the some settings and strings/prefix and also the name of the scoreboard.

-Obviously it kills the person if they log out while being in combat.

Thats about it!
